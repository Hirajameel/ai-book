# Chapter 1: Hands-on Exercise

## Exercise: Understanding Physical AI vs Digital AI

### Objective
Explore the differences between Physical AI and Digital AI by examining real-world examples and their characteristics.

### Part 1: Classification Exercise
Identify whether each of the following systems represents Physical AI or Digital AI:

1. ChatGPT answering questions
2. Autonomous vehicle navigating city streets
3. Recommendation system on Netflix
4. Robotic arm assembling products
5. Voice assistant controlling smart home
6. Image recognition for medical diagnosis
7. Warehouse robot moving packages
8. Language translation service

### Part 2: Nervous System Analogy
Consider a humanoid robot and map the following biological nervous system components to their ROS 2 equivalents:

- **Sensory organs** → ________________
- **Spinal cord** → ________________
- **Motor cortex** → ________________
- **Reflexes** → ________________
- **Brain regions** → ________________

### Part 3: ROS 2 Architecture Understanding
Explain in your own words why ROS 2 serves as the "spinal cord" of humanoid robots. Consider:
- Communication patterns
- Distributed processing
- Real-time requirements
- Safety considerations

### Discussion Questions
1. What are the main challenges that Physical AI systems face that Digital AI systems don't?
2. How does the biological nervous system analogy help in designing robotic systems?
3. Why is real-time response critical for Physical AI but not always for Digital AI?

### Solution Guide
- Physical AI: Systems that interact with the physical world (items 2, 4, 5, 7)
- Digital AI: Systems that operate purely in digital space (items 1, 3, 6, 8)
- ROS 2 as spinal cord: Provides communication infrastructure, enables distributed processing, handles real-time requirements
